# why?

* Where does this functionality live?
** screenshots from allstate/farmers?
* What's setting this style
* How should my javascript hook?
* SMACSS confuses me, what's a layout, a state, or a component?

* Object Orientation
* Composition over Inheritance
* DRYness
* Self-documentation
* Know immediately from the inspector where to go to find the relevant files
** JS/coffee
** SASS/CSS
** Soy
